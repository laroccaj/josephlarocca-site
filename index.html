            <p>Joseph LaRocca is a nationally recognized leader in asset protection and security with more than 25 years of experience driving measurable results across retail, corporate, and government sectors. As former Director of Loss Prevention for The Walt Disney Company’s Retail Division (Disney Stores), he led enterprise-wide strategies in loss prevention, crisis management, and business continuity, earning the company’s President’s Award and Team Excellence Award for protecting revenue and stabilizing operations during critical events. He founded LPInformation.com in 1998—later acquired by National Retail Federation—establishing one of the industry’s first large-scale digital collaboration platforms. A respected public speaker and media contributor, he has been at the forefront of addressing organized retail crime, emerging threats, and technology-driven risk.</p>

            <p>At the national level, LaRocca became a central figure in uniting retailers, law enforcement, and policymakers to combat organized retail crime and e-fencing. Working alongside the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, he initiated the publication of the national Active Shooter program and served as a founding member of the Commercial Facilities Sector Coordinating Council, as well as a private-sector advisor to the Homeland Security Information Network. In partnership with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE-HSI), he helped establish the S.E.A.R.C.H. program targeting criminal enterprise profits. He has provided expert testimony before Congress and multiple state legislatures, advised national infrastructure leaders during pandemic planning, and received recognition from the FBI for outstanding public safety contributions.</p>
